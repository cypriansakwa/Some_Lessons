This lesson explores how to use vectors (`Vec<Field>`) in Noir circuits.

### ✅ Concepts Covered

- Initializing vectors
- `push`, `pop`, `get`, and `len()` operations
- Performing computations over dynamic data
- Returning values from vector manipulations

### 🛠️ How to Run

```bash
cd Vectors_in_noir
```
Then navigate to each example. Inside each example folder, run:
```bash
nargo execute 
```
